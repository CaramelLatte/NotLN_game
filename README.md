# Night of the Living Nerds

Work in progress.

Simple topdown twin-stick style shooter. To play, download the latest C-compiled release or execute script with python.

If using python, you'll need to install python 3.9 and pygame

Move with wasd or arrow keys, aim and fire with left click, exit with esc key. 

Actual assets and things to come eventually. Maybe. Someday. Probably.
